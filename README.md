"# Websocket-Chat-Room" 

Bootstrap Websocket chat room that has built in private messaging between multiple partys.

This code was pulled from another project I built, I did my best to clean up the code and make it stand-alone, so you may need to change a few variables to get it to work. If you need to run multiple instances, you can do so by giving each dynamic page its own room id within the jQuery section. 

You can set the username at the top of the chat.php file if you are using a sessioned username, or in the demo we used a POST username from a form page.

You will need to edit the database details in dbconn.php and socketserver/index.js. PHP needs updated to 7.x

This project can be used internally for free, if you plan to use it in a commercial application please contact me @ darrylpolo@gmail.com to aqquire a license for commercial use.
